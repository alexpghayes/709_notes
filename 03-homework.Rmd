```{exercise, name = "Ex 2"}
Let $\C$ be a collection of subsets of $\Omega$ and let $\Gamma = \{ \F | \F \text{ is a } \sigma \text{-field on } \Omega \text{ and } \C \subset \F \}$. Show that $\Gamma \neq \emptyset$ and $\sigma(\C) = \cap_{\F \in \Gamma} \F$. 
```

```{solution, name = "Ex 2"}
Let $\P(\Omega)$ be the collection of all subsets of $\Omega$. We know that this is a $\sigma$-field. It also contains $\C$. Hence, $\Gamma \neq \emptyset$. 
 
By definition, $\sigma(\C)$ is the smallest $\sigma$-field that contains $\C$, hence $\sigma(\C) \in \Gamma$ and $\sigma(\C) \subset \F$ for all $\F \in \Gamma$. Therefore, $\sigma(\C) \subset \cap_{\F \in \Gamma} \F$. But since $\sigma(\C) \in \Gamma$, $\sigma(\C) \in \cap_{\F \in \Gamma} \F$, which in turn ensures that $\cap_{\F \in \Gamma} \F \subset \sigma(\C)$. 

Hence $\sigma(\C) = \cap_{\F \in \Gamma} \F$.

Let $\nu$ and $\lambda$ be two measures on $(\Omega, \F)$ such that $\nu(A) = \lambda(A)$ for any $A \in \C \subset \F$, where $\C$ is a $\pi$-system (\@ref(def:pi-system)). Assume that $\nu$ is $\sigma$-finite (\@ref(def:sigma-finite)). 

Show that $\nu(A) = \lambda(A)$ for all $A \in \sigma(\C)$.

```

```{solution, name = "Ex 12"}
Let $\F = \{A \in \sigma(\C) | \nu(A) = \lambda(A)\}$. Then $\C \subset \F$. If we can show that $\F$ is a $\sigma$-field, then $\sigma(\C) \subset \F$ (since $\sigma(\C)$ is the smallest $\sigma$-field that contains $\C$), which proves that $\nu(A) = \lambda(A)$ for all $A \in \sigma(\C)$.

```{exercise, name = "Ex 14"}
Prove proposition 1.4 (proposition \@ref(prp:borel-function-properties))
```

```{solution, name = "Ex 14 (i)"}

Assume $f$ is Borel. Then $f^{-1}(A) \in \F$ for all open sets $A \in \B$, hence $f^{-1}(a, \infty) \in \F$. 

Now assume $f^{-1}(a, \infty) \in \F$ for all $a \in \R$, and let $\mathcal{G} = \{ A \in \B | f^{-1}(A) \in \F \}$. So, $(a, \infty) \in \mathcal{G}$ for all $a \in \R$. If we can show that $\mathcal{G}$ is a $\sigma$-field, then we will have that $\sigma((a, \infty)) = \B \subset \mathcal{G}$, hence $f^{-1}(B) \in \F$ for all $B \in \B$, meaning that $f$ is measurable. 

So let us prove that $\mathcal{G}$ is a $\sigma$-field. 

a) First of all, $f^{-1}(\emptyset) = \emptyset \in \F$. 
b) Second, let $A \in \mathcal{G}$. Since $f^{-1}(A^C) = (f^{-1}(A))^C \in \F$ ($\F$ is a $\sigma$-field and $f^{-1}(A) \in \F$, so $(f^{-1}(A))(^C) \in \F$). 
c) Finally, let $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ be a sequence of sets such that $A_i \in \mathcal{G}$ for all $i$. Then $f^{-1}\left(\cup_{i=1}^\infty A_i \right) = \cup_{i=1}^\infty f^{-1}(A_i)$. Since $f^{-1}(A_i) \in \F$ for all $i$ and $\F$ is a $\sigma$-field, $\cup_{i=1}^\infty f^{-1}(A_i) \in \F$, so $\cup_{i=1}^\infty A_i \in \mathcal{G}$. 

So $\mathcal{G}$ is a $\sigma$-field, which concludes the proof.

```{solution, name = "Ex 14 (ii)"}
Assume $f$ and $g$ are Borel functions. Let $a,b \in \R$. $af$ is Borel, since 

$$
  (af)^{-1}((c,\infty)) = \left\{ \omega \in \Omega : a\cdot f(\omega) \in (c, \infty) \right\}.
$$
    
If $a \neq 0$,

$$\begin{aligned}
 (af)^{-1}((c,\infty)) &= \left\{ \omega \in \Omega : f(\omega) \in (\tfrac{c}{a}, \infty) \right\} \\
                       &= f^{-1}(\tfrac{c}{a}, \infty).
\end{aligned}$$

Since $f$ is Borel, this is a measurable set (by (i)). If $a = 0$, then 

$$(af)^{-1}((c,\infty)) = 
  \left\{ 
    \begin{matrix} 
      \Omega & \text{ if } c \le 0 \\ 
      \emptyset & \text{ if } c < 0 
    \end{matrix}
  \right .
$$

In either case, $(af)^{-1}((c, \infty)) \in \F$. Since it holds that for all $a,c \in \R$ that $(af)^{-1}((c,\infty)) \in \F$, $af$ is measurable by (i). 

Let $c \in \R$. Now consider the sum of $f$ and $g$:
  
$$\begin{aligned}
  (f + g)^{-1}((c, \infty)) &= \left\{ \omega \in \Omega : f(\omega) + g(\omega) > c \right\} \\.
                            &= \cup_{t \in \mb{Q}} \{\omega \in \Omega : f(\omega) > c - t \} \cap \{\omega \in \Omega : g(\omega) > t \} \\
                            &= \cup_{t \in \mb{Q}} f^{-1}((c-t, \infty)) \cap g^{-1}((t, \infty)).
\end{aligned}$$
  
Since $f$ and $g$ are both measurable, $f^{-1}((c-t, \infty)) \in \F$ and $g^{-1}((t, \infty))\in \F$ for all $t \in \R$. Hence, the intersection of the two is measurable for any $t \in \R$, which in turn implies that the union over all rational numbers is measurable (countable union of measurable sets). Hence, $f+g$ is measurable. 

Combine the two results to get the final result.^[Note: This could be done in one step, but I found it easier to split up into two.]

Assume $f$ is measurable from $(\Omega, \F)$ to $(\Lambda, \mathcal{G})$, and $g$ measureable from $(\Lambda, \mathcal{G})$ to $(\Delta, \mathcal{H})$. Let $H \in \mathcal{H}$. We want to show that $(g \circ f)^{-1}(H) \in \F$, since this would mean $g \circ f$ is measurable. So,

$$\begin{aligned}
  (g \circ f)^{-1}(H) &= \left\{ \omega \in \Omega | g(f(\omega)) \in H \right\} \\ 
                      &= \left\{ \omega \in \Omega | f(\omega) \in g^{-1}(H) \right\} \\ 
                      &= f^{-1}(g^{-1}(H)).
\end{aligned}$$
                        
Since $g$ is measurable, $g^{-1}(H) \in \mathcal{G}$, and since $f$ is measurable, $f^{-1}(g^{-1}(H)) \in \F$. So, $g \circ f$ is measurable.

Let $f: \Omega \rightarrow \R^p$, where $\Omega$ is a borel set. Assume $f$ is continuous. Then, if $A$ is an open set, $f^{-1}(A)$ is an open set, and therefore borel. Hence, $f^{-1}((a,\infty))$ is a borel set for all $a$, and by $(i)$ we have that $f$ is a borel function.

Prove proposition \@ref(prp:calc-radon-nikodym)
```

```{solution, name = "Ex 34 i)"}
Let $g$ be the unique function denoted by $\frac{d\lambda}{d\nu}$. Assume $f = 1_A$ for some $A\in \F$. Since $\lambda << \nu$, we know that $\lambda(A) = \int_A g d\nu$. So,

\begin{align*}
  \int f d\lambda &= \int 1_A d\lambda \\
                  &= \lambda(A) \\
                  &= \int_A g d\nu \\
                  &= \int 1_A g d\nu = \int f g d\nu.
\end{align*}

Hence, (i) is true for all indicator functions, and so by linearity of integrals (\@ref(prp:int-linearity)) for all non-negative simple functions. 

Now, let $f$ be a general non-negative Borel function. Then we know that there exists a sequence of simple functions $\phi_1, \phi_2, \ldots$ such that $\phi_n \uparrow f$. Hence, utilizing the monotone convergence theorem and the fact that we know (i) holds for simple functions,

\begin{align*}
  \int f d\lambda &= \int \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \phi_n d\lambda \\
                  &= \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \int \phi_n d\lambda \\
                  &= \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \int \phi_n g d\nu \\
                  &= \int \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \phi_n g d\nu \\
                  &= \int f g d\nu,
\end{align*}

and so we have shown that (i) holds for any non-negative Borel function. 

```

```{solution, name = "Ex 34 ii)"}
Assume $\lambda_1 << \nu$ and $\lambda_2 << \nu$. Then

\begin{align*}
  (\lambda_1 + \lambda_2)(A) &= \lambda_1(A) + \lambda_2(A) \\
                             &= \int_A g_1 d\nu + \int_A g_2 d\nu \\
                             &= \int_A (g_1 + g_2)d\nu,
\end{align*}

so $\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 << \nu$, and 

$$\frac{d(\lambda_1 + \lambda_2)}{d\nu} = g_1 + g_2 = \frac{d\lambda_1}{d\nu} + \frac{d\lambda_2}{d\nu}.$$
  
```

```{solution, name = "Ex 34 iii)"}
Since $\tau << \lambda$, 

$$\tau(A) = \int_A \frac{d\tau}{d\lambda}d\lambda.$$ 
  
Since $\lambda << \nu$, we can use (i) with $f = \frac{d\tau}{d\lambda}$, to get 

$$\tau(A) = \int_A \frac{d\tau}{d\lambda}\frac{d\lambda}{d\tau} d\tau,$$

which tells us that $\tau << \nu$ and 

$$\frac{d\tau}{d\nu} = \frac{d\tau}{d\lambda}\frac{d\lambda}{d\tau}.$$

```

```{solution, name = "Ex 34 iv)"}

By definition, $(\lambda_1 \times \lambda_2)(A) = \int_A d(\lambda_1 \times \lambda_2) = \int 1_A d(\lambda_1 \times \lambda_2)$. Since $1_A \ge 0$, we can use Fubini to get

$$ (\lambda_1 \times \lambda_2)(A) = \int \int 1_A d\lambda_1 d\lambda_2. $$

Since $\lambda_1 << \nu_1$, we can use (i) with $f = 1_A$ ($1_A$ is non-negative) to obtain that 

$$(\lambda_1 \times \lambda_2)(A) = \int \int 1_A \frac{d\lambda_1}{d\nu_1}d\nu_1 d\lambda_2,$$ 

and then, since $\lambda_2 << \nu_2$, using (i) again with $f = \int 1_A \frac{d\lambda_1}{d\nu_1}d\nu_1$ (which is non-negative) to get 

$$(\lambda_1 \times \lambda_2)(A) = \int \int 1_A \frac{d\lambda_1}{d\nu_1}d\nu_1 \frac{d\lambda_2}{d\nu_2}d\nu_2.$$ 
  
Finally, using Fubini again we get

$$\begin{aligned}
  (\lambda_1 \times \lambda_2)(A) &= \int \int 1_A \frac{d\lambda_1}{d\nu_1}\frac{d\lambda_2}{d\nu_2} d\nu_1 d\nu_2 \\
                                  &= \int_A \frac{d\lambda_1}{d\nu_1}\frac{d\lambda_2}{d\nu_2} d(\nu_1\times\nu_2).
\end{aligned}$$
  
I.e. $\lambda_1 \times \lambda_2 << \nu_1 \times \nu_2$ and $\frac{d(\lambda_1 \times \lambda_2)}{d(\nu_1 \times \nu_2)} = \frac{d\lambda_1}{d\nu_1}\frac{d\lambda_2}{d\nu_2}$.

Let $\{a_n\}$ be a sequence of positive numbser with $\sum_{i=1}^\infty a_n = 1$, and $\{P_n\}$ a sequence of probability measure on a common measurable space, $(\Omega, \F)$. Define $P = \sum_{n=1}^\infty P_n$.

a) Show that $P$ is a probability measure.
b) Let $\nu$ be a $\sigma$-finite measure. Show that 

$$P_n << \nu \text{ for all } n \in \mb{N}\quad \iff \quad P << \nu.$$

c) Derive the Lebesgue p.d.f. of $P$ when $P_n$ is the gamma distribution $\Gamma(\alpha, n^{-1})$ with $\alpha > 1$ and $a_n \propto n^{-\alpha}$.

```{solution, name = "Ex 35 a)"}
Need to show that $P = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n P_n$ is a probability measure. So we check the three properties for a probability measure (\@ref(def:measure)), with the extra property that $P(\Omega) = 1$:

i) $P(A) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n P_n(A) \geq 0$ for all $A$ since $a_n > 0$ for all $n$ by assumption, and $P_n(A) \ge 0$ for all $n$, since $P_n$ is a probability measure. Furthermore, $P(\Omega) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n P_n(\Omega) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n = 1$, where the second equality holds since $P_n$ is a probability measure (by assumption), and the last equality is exactly the assumption we made about the $a_n$s. I.e. $0 \le P(A) \le 1$. 
ii) Since $P_n(\emptyset) = 0$, $P(\emptyset) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n P_n(\emptyset) = 0$.
iii) Let $A_1, A_2,\ldots$ be a countable sequence of pairwise disjoint sets. Then using that $P_n$ is a measure for all $n$,

$$\begin{aligned}
  P(\cup_{i=1}^\infty A_i) &= \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_nP_n\left(\cup_{i=1}^\infty A_i\right) \\
                           &= \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n\sum_{i=1}^\infty P_n(A_i) \\
                           &= \sum_{i=1}^\infty \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n P_n(A_i) \\
                           &= \sum_{i=1}^\infty P(A_i).
\end{aligned}$$

```

```{solution, name = "Ex 35 b)"}
Assume $P << \nu$. Let $A \in \F$ with $\nu(A) = 0$. Assume there exists $n \in \mb{N}$ such that $P_n(A) > 0$. Then $P(A) > a_n P_n(A) > 0$. But $P << \nu$ implies that $P(A) = 0$, so by contradiction, $P_n(A) = 0$ for all $n \in \mb{N}$. 

Now assume $P_n << \nu$. Let $A \in \F$ with $\nu(A) = 0$. Then $P_n(A) = 0$ for all $n \in \mb{N}$. Hence, $P(A) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n P_n(A) = 0$, which means that $P << \nu$.

First rewrite the RHS in terms of PDFS

$$\int_0^\infty \int_x^\infty f(y) dy dx - \int_{-\infty}^0 \int_{-\infty}^x f(y) dy dx$$
  
Then we can use Fubini (since $f$ is positive) to switch the order of the integrals

$$
\begin{aligned}
&= \int_0^\infty \int_0^y f(y) dy dx - \int_{-\infty}^0 \int_{-y}^0 f(y) dy dx \\
&= \int_0^\infty f(y) \int_0^y 1 dx dy - \int_{-\infty}^0 f(y) \int_{-y}^0 1 dx dy \\

$E Y_n = \int_0^\infty {1 \over n}  P(\max_{i \le n} |X_i| > t) dt$ by exercise 1.55. The integrand is then bounded by

$${1 \over n} \sum P(\max_{i \le n} |X_i| > t)$$
  
which equals ${1 \over n}  P(|X_1| > t)$ since the $X_i$ are identical. This is finite by hypothesis. Thus we can apply the DCT to see that 

$$\lim E Y_n = \int_0^\infty \lim {1 \over n}  P(\max_{i \le n} |X_i| > t) dt = 0$$
```


```{solution, name = "Ex 115 (b)"}
The condition that $E |X_1|$ converges and being identical gives us that that $ \lim X_n / n$ converges to zero almost surely. then we truncate. for some large enough N, $X_n / n$ must be less than epsilon. then for $|X_n| / n$ for n < N, there are only finitely many cases and so the max exists and is bounded, and goes to zero by the $n$ in the denominator. this gives us that $\lim Y_n$ goes to zero as $n$ goes to zero. in fact it goes to zero almost everywhere, since the limit $|X_n| / n$ goes to zero almost everywhere by the hypothesis that $X_n$ is absolutely integrable. thus $\lim Y_n$ goes to zero almost surely.

(a) Suppose X_n converge in distribution to X. Show X_n is O_P(1).
```

```{solution, name = "Ex 127 (a)"}
Suppose X_n converge in distribution to X. For large enough M, we have $P(|X| > M) < \epsilon_1$ (i.e the tail probability is small). For large enough $n$,  $P(|X_n| > \epsilon_1) - P(|X| > \epsilon) < \epsilon) < $\epsilon_2$. Pick $n$ large enough so that $\epsilon_2$ is controlled.

### Suggested Problems

```{exercise, name = "Ex 3"}
Let $\Omega, \F_j)$, $j=1,2,\ldots$, be measurable spaces such that $\F_j \subset \F_{j+1}$. Is $\cup_j \F_j$ a $\sigma$-field?
```

```{solution, name = "Ex 3"}
No.

Let $\Omega = [0,1]$, and $\F_n = \sigma \left\{[0,\tfrac{1}{2^n}),[\tfrac{1}{2^n},\tfrac{2}{2^n}), \ldots, [\tfrac{2^{n-1}}{2^n}, 1)\right\}$. 

Now, consider the set $B_n = [0, \tfrac{1}{2^n})$. Clearly $B_n \in \F_n$ for all $n$, hence $B_n \in \cup_{i=1}^\infty \F_i$. Hower, $\cap_{i = 1}^{\infty} B_i = \{0\} \notin \cup_{i=1}^\infty \F_i$. So $\cup_{i=1}^\infty \F_i$ is not closed under countable intersection, i.e. it is not a $\sigma$-algebra.

Prove part (ii) and (iii) of proposition \@ref(prp:properties-of-measures). 
```

```{solution, name = "Ex 6"}

i) Let $A \subset B$. Then $B \setminus A \cap A = \emptyset$, hence $\nu(B) = \nu((B\setminus A) \cup A) = \nu(B\setminus A) + \nu(A) \geq \nu(A)$. 

ii) Let $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ be a sequence of sets. Define $B_i = A_i \setminus \left(\cup_{k = 1}^{i-1} A_k \right)$. Then the $B_i$s are pairwise disjoint. Hence, 

\begin{align*}
  \nu\left(\cup_{i = 1}^\infty A_i\right) &= \nu\left(\cup_{i=1}^\infty B_i\right) \\
                                          &= \sum_{i=1}^\infty \nu(B_i) \\
                                          &= \sum_{i=1}^\infty \nu\left(A_i \setminus \left(\cup_{k=1}^{i-1} A_k \right ) \right ).
\end{align*}

Since $A_i \setminus \left(\cup_{k=1}^{i-1} A_k \right) \subset A_i$, we use (i) to get the result:
  
\begin{align*}
  \sum_{i=1}^\infty \nu\left(A_i \setminus \left(\cup_{k=1}^{i-1} A_k \right ) \right ) \leq \sum_{i=1}^\infty \nu\left(A_i \right )
\end{align*}


iii) Let $A_1 \subset A_2 \subset A_3 \subset \dots$. Define $B_i = A_i \setminus A_{i-1}$. Then $B_1, B_2, \ldots$ is a sequence of pairwise disjoint sets, and $\cup_{i = 1}^\infty B_i = \cup_{i=1}^\infty A_i$. Hence,

\begin{align*}
  \nu\left(\cup_{i=1}^k A_i\right) &= \nu\left(\cup_{i=1}^k B_i\right) \\
                                   &= \sum_{i=1}^k \nu(B_i) \\
                                   &= \sum_{i=1}^k \nu(A_i\setminus A_{i-1}) \\
                                   &= \sum_{i=1}^k \nu(A_i) - \nu(A_{i-1}) \\
                                   &= \nu(A_k). 
\end{align*}
                                   
Taking the limit on both sides gives us 

$$
  \nu\left(\cup_{i=1}^k A_i \right) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \nu(A_n).
$$
