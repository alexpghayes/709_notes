My notes for STAT 709: Mathematical Statistics. The "book" consists of four "chapters":

1) Intro: this outlines overall notation and things I want to point out that are relevant to everything
2) Lecture Notes: these will be my notes on the lectures. Mainly a collection of the relevant definitions, theorems, lemmas, propositions, examples. Will also include small snippets of text with further explanation, whenever I have something relevant to say.
3) Discussion Notes: as 2), but for discussion sessions.
4) Homework: My solutions to the homework problems. 

The structure so far is such that each chapter has it's own .Rmd file. It might be beneficial to somehow break down the .Rmd files into several files, but not sure if a) it's possible, and b) it makes sense. 

One note re: lecture notes. I've tried to include headers where material flows from one lecture to the next. This kind of messes with the overall layout. I've tried to figure out how to include a header in the text without adding it as a subsection. This is obviously possible (if nothing else, some html magic will do), just haven't implemented yet.
